# OutputSwitcher
Windows desktop utility for switching between desktop display configurations without going in to Settings.

This goes beyond the functionality provided in Windows for quick desktop switching through the WIN+P hotkey as this allows for display configurations beyond two displays and the extend/projection scenarios.

This utility provides a command line interface that can be interactive or used with command line switches in scripts, as well as a tray application with UI for managing display configurations and registering global hotkeys for switching to specific configurations.
